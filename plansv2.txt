# Text-Based RPG

Ideas:
    -> Simple stat tables
    -> Full unit testing from beginning
    -> Yaml balance configuration

Next Steps:
    -> Key collection for final boss
    -> One accessory to stack with base stats

Limitations:
    -> Only one character
    -> Bare-bones text-based UI using malt
    -> Keyword input
    -> No multi-item inventories
    -> Simple monsters
    -> No seed sharing
    -> No custom objects
    -> Avoid in-place mutation where possible
    -> Only four stats

Structures:
    Stat Table: Dictionary
        -HP, PW, DF, SP only
        -Generated from function, never handmade
    Keyring: Integer
        -Increments by chance after beating monster
    Monster: Stat Table
        -Will need more complexity in the future maybe
    Character: Stat Table
    Held Item: Stat Table

##Dungeon

Dungeon is a very small game that is played on the linux terminal. It 
sacrifices fancy I/O methods and graphics for simplicity. If I actually finish 
it I will be very happy. It seems to be going that way so far.

The master branch is stable for now, so I am ceasing work on it. New changes
will happen on the new refactor branch.

##Dungeon

Dungeon is a very small game that is played on the linux terminal. It 
sacrifices fancy I/O methods and graphics for simplicity. If I actually finish 
it I will be very happy. It seems to be going that way so far.

The master branch is at a stable state, so I'm going to leave it be for now.
I'll be working on the refactor branch trying to integrate what I've learned
about unit testing into the project. When I have good test coverage I will
merge back into master.
